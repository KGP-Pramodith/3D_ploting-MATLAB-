# 🔍 Exploring 3D Plotting in MATLAB! 📊✨

I recently stepped into the world of 3D plotting with MATLAB, and it was an exciting experience!
I experimented with:

✅ plot3 – for line plots in 3D
✅ scatter3 – for 3D scatter plots
✅ mesh – for wireframe surfaces
✅ surf – for colored 3D surfaces
✅ contour3 – for 3D contour mapping

Each function gave me a new perspective on how data can be visualized in space. Seeing the plots come to life was not just fun, but also a great way to understand mathematical relationships and surface behaviors.

This is just the beginning — I’m looking forward to using these tools for more advanced simulations and research work!
